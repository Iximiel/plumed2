## Version 2.10 (under development)

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.10

Changes from version 2.8 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to differences with previous versions:
  - Now using NeighborList with too many atoms will result in a clear memory error and not in an undefined behaviour due to the overflow in integer multiplication.

- Changes relevant for developers:
  - Removed some shortcuts for `ActionRegister.h` (from the modules bias colvar function sasa and vatom) and `CLToolRegister.h` (from the module cltools), now the two headers can only be included with `#include "core/ActionRegister.h"` or `#include "core/CLToolRegister.h"`.
