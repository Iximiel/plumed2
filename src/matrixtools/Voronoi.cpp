//+PLUMEDOC MCOLVAR VORONOI
/*
Do a voronoi analysis

This shortcut allows you to perform a [Voronoi analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
The input to this action is a rectangular matrix that describes the distances between two sets of points.
The points for which this action is receiving distances between could be atom positions or they could represent the 
dissimilarities between various trajectory frames that have been stored using [COLLECT_FRAMES](COLLECT_FRAMES.md).
In the example below the matrix of input distances are distances between the positions of atoms:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE_MATRIX GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-100
v: VORONOI ARG=d
ones: ONES SIZE=90
c: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=v,ones
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar 
```

The VORONOI action outputs a rectangular matrix, $V$, with the same shape as the input matrix, $D$. $V_{ij}$ 
is 1 if $D_{ij}$ is the shortest distance in row $i$.
