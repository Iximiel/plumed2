/*
Measure how similar the environment around atoms is to that found in a FCC structure.

This shortcut is an example of a [COORDINATION_SHELL_AVERAGE](COORDINATION_SHELL_AVERAGE.md),
which we can use to measure how similar the environment around atom $i$ is to an fcc structure.
The function that is used to make this determination is as follows:

$$
s_i = \frac{ \sum_{i \ne j} \sigma(r_{ij}) \left\{ a\left[ \frac{(x_{ij}y_{ij})^4 + (x_{ij}z_{ij})^4 + (y_{ij}z_{ij})^4}{r_{ij}^8} - \frac{\alpha (x_{ij}y_{ij}z_{ij})^4}{r_{ij}^{12}} \right] + b \right\} }{ \sum_{i \ne j} \sigma(r_{ij}) }
$$


In this expression $x_{ij}$, $y_{ij}$ and $z_{ij}$ are the $x$, $y$ and $z$ components of the vector connecting atom $i$ to
atom $j$ and $r_{ij}$ is the magnitude of this vector.  $\sigma(r_{ij})$ is a switching function that acts on the distance between
atom $i$ and atom $j$ and its inclusion in the numerator and the denominator of the above expression as well as the fact that we are summing
over all of the other atoms in the system ensures that we are calculating an average
of the function of $x_{ij}$, $y_{ij}$ and $z_{ij}$ for the atoms in the first coordination sphere around atom $i$.  Lastly, $\alpha$
is a parameter that can be set by the user, which by default is equal to three.  The values of $a$ and $b$ are calculated from $\alpha$ using:

$$
a = \frac{ 80080}{ 2717 + 16 \alpha} \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad b = \frac{ 16(\alpha - 143) }{2717 + 16\alpha}
$$

This action was been used in all the articles in the bibliography. We thus wrote an explict
action to calculate it in PLUMED instead of using a shortcut as we did for [SIMPLECUBIC](SIMPLECUBIC.md) so that we could get
good computational performance.  Notice also that you can you can rotate the bond vectors before computing the
function in the above expression by using the PHI, THETA and PSI keywords as is discussed in the documentation for [COORDINATION_SHELL_FUNCTION](COORDINATION_SHELL_FUNCTION.md).

The following input calculates the FCCUBIC parameter for the 64 atoms in the system
and then calculates and prints the average value for this quantity.

```plumed
d: FCCUBIC SPECIES=1-64 D_0=3.0 R_0=1.5 NN=6 MM=12
dm: MEAN ARG=d PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=dm FILE=colv
```

In the input above we use a rational [switching function](LESS_THAN.md) with the parameters above. We would recommend using SWITCH syntax
rather than the syntax above when giving the parameters for the switching function as you can then use any of the switching functions described
in the documentation for [LESS_THAN](LESS_THAN.md).  More importantly, however, using this syntax allows you to set the D_MAX parameter for the
switching function as demonstrated below:

```plumed
d: FCCUBIC SPECIES=1-64 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=3.0 R_0=1.5 D_MAX=6.0}
dm: MEAN ARG=d PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=dm FILE=colv
```

Setting the `D_MAX` can substantially improve PLUMED performance as it turns on the linked list algorithm that is discussed in the optimisation details part
of the documentation for [CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md).

## Working with two types of atom

If you would like to calculate whether the atoms in GROUPB are arranged around the atoms in GROUPA as they in in an FCC structure you use an input like the one
shown below:

```plumed
d: FCCUBIC SPECIESA=1-64 SPECIESB=65-200 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=3.0 R_0=1.5 D_MAX=6.0}
lt: MORE_THAN ARG=d SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.5}
s: SUM ARG=lt PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=s FILE=colv
```

This input calculates how many of the 64 atoms that were input to the SPECIESA keyword have an fcc value that is greater than 0.5.

## The MASK keyword

You can use the MASK keyword with this action in the same way that it is used with [COORDINATIONNUMBER](COORDINATIONNUMBER.md).  This keyword thus expects a vector in
input, which tells FCCUBIC that it is safe not to calculate the FCCUBIC parameter for some of the atoms.  As illustrated below, this is useful if you are using functionality
from the [volumes module](module_volumes.md) to calculate the average value of the FCCUBIC parameter for only those atoms that lie in a certain part of the simulation box.

```plumed
# Fixed virtual atom which serves as the probe volume's center (pos. in nm)
center: FIXEDATOM AT=2.5,2.5,2.5
# Vector in which element i is one if atom i is in sphere of interest and zero otherwise
sphere: INSPHERE ATOMS=1-400 CENTER=center RADIUS={GAUSSIAN D_0=0.5 R_0=0.01 D_MAX=0.52}
# Calculate the fccubic parameter of the atoms
cc: FCCUBIC ...
  SPECIES=1-400 MASK=sphere
  SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=3.0 R_0=1.5 D_MAX=6.0}
...
# Multiply fccubic parameters numbers by sphere vector
prod: CUSTOM ARG=cc,sphere FUNC=x*y PERIODIC=NO
# Sum of coordination numbers for atoms that are in the sphere of interest
numer: SUM ARG=prod PERIODIC=NO
# Number of atoms that are in sphere of interest
denom: SUM ARG=sphere PERIODIC=NO
# Average coordination number for atoms in sphere of interest
av: CUSTOM ARG=numer,sphere FUNC=x/y PERIODIC=NO
# And print out final CV to a file
PRINT ARG=av FILE=colvar STRIDE=1
```

This input calculate the average value of the FCCUBIC parameter for only those atoms that are within a spherical region that is centered on the point
$(2.5,2.5,2.5)$.

## Deprecated syntax

More information on the deprecated keywords that are given below is available in the documentation for the [DISTANCES](DISTANCES.md) command.

Measure how similar the environment around atoms is to that found in a FCC structure.

This is the function that is used in the [FCCUBIC](FCCUBIC.md) shortcut. You can see an example that shows how it is used
if you expand the FCCUBIC shortcut in the following example input:

```plumed
