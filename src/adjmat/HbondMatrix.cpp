Adjacency matrix in which two atoms are adjacent if there is a hydrogen bond between them.

A useful tool for developing complex collective variables is the notion of the
so called adjacency matrix.  An adjacency matrix is an $N \times N$ matrix in which the $i$th, $j$th element tells you whether
or not the $i$th and $j$th atoms/molecules from a set of $N$ atoms/molecules are adjacent or not.  As detailed in the documentation
for [CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md) there are then a range of further analyses that you can perform on these matrices.

For this action the elements of the adjacency matrix are calculated using:

$$
a_{ij} = \sigma_{oo}( |\mathbf{r}_{ij}| ) \sum_{k=1}^N \sigma_{oh}( |\mathbf{r}_{ik}| ) \sigma_{\theta}( \theta_{kij} )
$$

This expression was derived by thinking about how to detect if there is a hydrogen bond between atoms $i$ and $j$.  The notion is that
if the hydrogen bond is present atoms $i$ and $j$ should be within a certain cutoff distance.  In addition, there should be a hydrogen
within a certain cutoff distance of atom $i$ and this hydrogen should lie on or close to the vector connecting atoms $i$ and $j$.
As such $\sigma_{oo}(r_{ij})$ is a switching function that acts on the modulus of the vector connecting atom $i$ to atom
$j$.  The sum over $k$ then runs over all the hydrogen atoms that are specified using using HYDROGEN keyword.  $\sigma_{oh}(r_{ik})$
is a switching function that acts on the modulus of the vector connecting atom $i$ to atom $k$ and $\sigma_{\theta}(\theta_{kij})$
is a switching function that acts on the angle between the vector connecting atoms $i$ and $j$ and the vector connecting atoms $i$ and
$k$.

It is important to note that hydrogen bonds, unlike regular bonds, are asymmetric. In other words, the hydrogen atom does not sit at the
mid point between the two other atoms in this three-center bond.  As a result of this adjacency matrices calculated using HBOND_MATRIX are not
symmetric like those calculated by [CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md).

Each water molecule can participate in a hydrogen bond in one of two ways.  It can either donate one of its hydrogen atom to the neighboring oxygen or
it can accept a bond between the hydrogen of a neighboring water molecule and its own oxygen.

The following input can be used to analyze the number of hydrogen bonds each of the oxygen atoms in a box of water donates. This information is output in an
xyz files which contains five columns of data.  The first four of these columns are a label for the atom and the x, y and z position of the oxygen.  The last column is then
the number of hydrogen bond that water molecule donates.

```plumed
mat: HBOND_MATRIX ...
   DONORS=1-192:3 ACCEPTORS=1-192:3 HYDROGENS=2-192:3,3-192:3
   SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=3.20} HSWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.30}
   ASWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.167pi}
...
ones: ONES SIZE=64
rsums: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=mat,ones
DUMPATOMS ATOMS=1-192:3 ARG=rsums FILE=donors.xyz
```

If you want to calculate the number of hydorgen bonds each of the oxygen atoms accepts you would use an input like the one below:

```plumed
mat: HBOND_MATRIX ...
   DONORS=1-192:3 ACCEPTORS=1-192:3 HYDROGENS=2-192:3,3-192:3
   SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=3.20} HSWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.30}
   ASWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.167pi}
...
matT: TRANSPOSE ARG=mat
ones: ONES SIZE=64
rsums: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=matT,ones
DUMPATOMS ATOMS=1-192:3 ARG=rsums FILE=acceptors.xyz
```

Consequently, if you want the total number of hydrogen bonds each oxygen atom participates in you need to use the following input:

```plumed
mat: HBOND_MATRIX ...
   DONORS=1-192:3 ACCEPTORS=1-192:3 HYDROGENS=2-192:3,3-192:3
   SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=3.20} HSWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.30}
   ASWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.167pi}
...
matT: TRANSPOSE ARG=mat
hbmat: CUSTOM ARG=mat,matT FUNC=x+y PERIODIC=NO
ones: ONES SIZE=64
rsums: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=hbmat,ones
DUMPATOMS ATOMS=1-192:3 ARG=rsums FILE=hbonds.xyz
```

Notice that in all the inputs above the $r_{ij}$ and $r_{ik}$ values that enter the formula above are calculated in a way that takes the
periodic boundary conditions into account.  If you want to ignore the periodic boundary conditions you can use the NOPBC flag as shown below.

```plumed
mat: HBOND_MATRIX ...
   DONORS=1-192:3 ACCEPTORS=1-192:3 HYDROGENS=2-192:3,3-192:3
   SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=3.20} HSWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.30}
   ASWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.167pi}
   NOPBC
...
```

## COMPONENTS flag

If you add the flag COMPONENTS to the input as shown below:

```plumed
c4: HBOND_MATRIX ...
  DONORS=1-192:3 ACCEPTORS=1-192:3 HYDROGENS=2-192:3,3-192:3
  SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=3.20} HSWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.30}
  ASWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.167pi}
  COMPONENTS
...
```

then four matrices with the labels `c4.w`, `c4.x`, `c4.y` and `c4.z` are output by the action. The matrix with the label `c4.w` is the adjacency matrix
that would be output if you had not added the COMPONENTS flag. The $i,j$ component of the matrices `c4.x`, `c4.y` and `c4.z` contain the $x$, $y$ and $z$
components of the vector connecting atoms $j$ and $k$. Importantly, however, the components of these vectors are only stored in `c4.x`, `c4.y` and `c4.z`
if the elements of `c4.w` are non-zero. Using the COMPONENTS flag in this way ensures that you can use HBOND_MATRIX in tandem with many of the functionalities
that are part of the [symfunc module](module_symfunc.md).  Remember, however, that the $i,j$ element of the HBOND_MATRIX is only non-zero if atom $i$ donates
a hydrogen bond to atom $j$.  __You cannot use HBOND_MATRIX to identify the set of atoms that each atom is hydrogen bonded to.__

## The MASK keyword

You use the MASK keyword with HBOND_MATRIX in the same way that is used in [CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md).  This keyword thus expects a vector in input,
which tells HBOND_MATRIX that it is safe to not calculate certain rows of the output matrix.  An example where this keyword is used is shown below:

```plumed
# Fixed virtual atom which serves as the probe volume's center (pos. in nm)
center: FIXEDATOM AT=2.5,2.5,2.5
# Vector in which element i is one if atom i is in sphere of interest and zero otherwise
sphere: INSPHERE ATOMS=1-192:3 CENTER=center RADIUS={GAUSSIAN D_0=0.5 R_0=0.01 D_MAX=0.52}
# Calculates cooordination numbers
cmap: HBOND_MATRIX ...
  DONORS=1-192:3 ACCEPTORS=1-192:3 HYDROGENS=2-192:3,3-192:3
  SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=3.20} HSWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.30}
  ASWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.167pi} MASK=sphere
...
ones: ONES SIZE=64
cc: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cmap,ones
# Multiply coordination numbers by sphere vector
prod: CUSTOM ARG=cc,sphere FUNC=x*y PERIODIC=NO
# Sum of coordination numbers for atoms that are in the sphere of interest
numer: SUM ARG=prod PERIODIC=NO
# Number of atoms that are in sphere of interest
denom: SUM ARG=sphere PERIODIC=NO
# Average coordination number for atoms in sphere of interest
av: CUSTOM ARG=prod,sphere FUNC=x/y PERIODIC=NO
# And print out final CV to a file
PRINT ARG=av FILE=colvar STRIDE=1
```

This input calculates the average number of hydrogen bonds each of the aatoms that are within a spherical region that is centered on the point
$(2.5,2.5,2.5)$ donate.

## Optimisation details

Adjacency matrices are sparse.  Each atom is only be connected to a small number of neighbours and the vast majority of the elements of the contact matrix are thus zero.  To reduce
the amount of memory that PLUMED requires PLUMED uses sparse matrix storage.  Consequently, whenever you calculate and store a contact matrix only the elements of the matrix that are
non-zero are stored.  The same thing holds for the additional values that are created when you use the COMPONENTS flag. The components of the vectors connecting atoms are only stored
when the elements of `c4.w` are non-zero.

We can also use the sparsity of the adjacency matrix to make the time required to compute a contact matrix scale linearly rather than quadratically with the number of atoms. Element
$i,j$ of the contact matrix is only non-zero if two atoms are within a cutoff, $r_c$. We can determine that many pairs of atoms are further appart than $r_c$ without computing the
distance between these atoms by using divide and conquer strategies such as linked lists and neighbour lists.  __To turn on these features you need to set the `D_MAX` parameter in the
switching functions.__ The value you pass to the `D_MAX` keyword is used as the cutoff in the link cell algorithm.

In theory we could further optimize the implementation of the HBOND_MATRIX action by exploiting neighbor lists. If we were to do this we would likely add two further keywords as shown
below:

```plumed
cmap: HBOND_MATRIX ...
  DONORS=1-192:3 ACCEPTORS=1-192:3 HYDROGENS=2-192:3,3-192:3
  SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=3.20 D_MAX=4.0} HSWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.30 D_MAX=3.5}
  ASWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.167pi}
  NL_CUTOFF=5.0 NL_STRIDE=5
...
```

The `NL_CUTOFF` keyword would be used to specify the cutoff (in nm) to use when constructing neighbor lists.  This value would need to be slightly larger than the D_MAX parameter for the switching function that
acts on the acceptor donor distance.
The `NL_STRIDE` keyword would then be used to specify how frequently the neighbour list should be updated.  Thus far we have not found it necessary to implement this algorithm. We have been happy with the
performance even if we use the linked list algorithm to update the neighbors on every step. If you feel that you need this CV to perform better please get in touch as adding a neighbor list for this action
should be relatively straightforward.
