//+PLUMEDOC PRINTANALYSIS DUMPFORCES
/*
Dump the force acting on one of a values in a file.

Consider the following PLUMED input:

```plumed
r: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
V: RESTRAINT ARG=r AT=0.2 KAPPA=100
```

This input will ultimately apply forces on the $x$, $y$ and $z$ components of two
atoms as well as the 9 cell vectors.  The force on the $i$th of these 15 quantities
is given by:

$$
F_i = - \frac{\textrm{d}V}{\textrm{d}r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x_i}
$$

where $x_i$ is the $x$, $y$ or $z$ component of the position of one of the two atoms or one of the cell
vectors.  If we modify the input above by adding the DUMPFORCES command as shown below:

```plumed
r: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
V: RESTRAINT ARG=r AT=0.2 KAPPA=100
DUMPFORCES ARG=r FILE=forces STRIDE=5 FMT=%10.5f
```

we can then monitor the value of $-\frac{\textrm{d}V}{\textrm{d}r}$ in the output file
`forces`.  As explained by the equation above to get the forces on the atom this 'input force' needs to
be multiplied by $\frac{\partial r}{\partial x_i}$.  To view the various components of the $\frac{\partial r}{\partial x_i}$
you would use the [DUMPDERIVATIVES](DUMPDERIVATIVES.md) command.  To control the buffering of output you use the
[FLUSH](FLUSH.md) command.

##Â DUMPFORCES and RESTART

If you run a calculation with the following input:

```plumed
r: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
V: RESTRAINT ARG=r AT=0.2 KAPPA=100
DUMPFORCES ARG=r FILE=forces
```

and a file called forces is already present in the directory where the calculation is running, the existing file is backed up
and renamed to `bck.0.forces` so that new data can be output to a new file called `forces`.  If you would like to append to the
existing file you can use the RESTART command as shown below:

```plumed
r: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
V: RESTRAINT ARG=r AT=0.2 KAPPA=100
DUMPFORCES ARG=r FILE=forces RESTART=YES
```

You can achieve the same result by using the [RESTART](RESTART.md) action as shown below:

```plumed
RESTART
r: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
V: RESTRAINT ARG=r AT=0.2 KAPPA=100
DUMPFORCES ARG=r FILE=forces
```

However, the advantage of using the RESTART keyword is that you can apped to some files and back up others.
If you use the [RESTART](RESTART.md) action instead data will be appended to all output files.

## Switching printing on and off

You can use the UPDATE_FROM and UPDATE_UNTIL flags to make the DUMPFORCES command only output data at certain points during the trajectory.
To see how this works consider the following example:

```plumed
r: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
V: RESTRAINT ARG=r AT=0.2 KAPPA=100
DUMPFORCES ...
  ARG=r FILE=forces
  UPDATE_FROM=100 UPDATE_UNTIL=500
  STRIDE=1
...
```

During the first 100 ps of the simulation with this input the force is not output to the file called forces.
The force is instead first output after the first 100 ps of trajectory have elapsed.  Furthermore, output of the force stops
once the trajectory is longer than 500 ps. In other words, the force is only output during the 400 ps time interval after the first
100 ps of the simulation.
