Print quantities to a file.

This command can be used to output quantities to a file. The following demonstrates a very
simple example:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=colvar
```

This command outputs the distance between atom 1 and 2 to a file called colvar every step of
trajectory. If you want to output the distance less frequently you can use the STRIDE keyword
as illustrated below:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=colvar STRIDE=10
```

With the input above the distance is only output on every 10th step. Notice this distance will only
be calculated on every step as this quantity is not used on every other step.

You can also control the format of the numbers that are output by using the FMT keyword as shown below:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=colvar FMT=%10.6f
```

The FMT key takes a [C format specifiers](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/c-tutorial/format-specifiers-in-c)
in input, which is what determines the appearance of the numbers output.

You can also use the PRINT command to output objects that have a rank that is greater than zero.
For example, the following input calculates a vector of three distances. These three distances
are then output to the output colvar file every step.

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS1=1,2 ATOMS2=3,4 ATOMS3=5,6
PRINT ARG=d FILE=colvar
```

Alterantively, we can output a matrix by using an input like the one shown below:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE_MATRIX GROUP=1-4
PRINT ARG=d FILE=colvar
```

The output `colvar` file here will contain the 16 elements of the matrix on each line output. You can
also use PRINT to output functions on grids. However, you are probably better using [DUMPGRID](DUMPGRID.md) or
[DUMPCUBE](DUMPCUBE.md) to output functions on grids.

The PRINT directive can be used multiple times in the input so you can print files with different strides or print different quantities
to different files as illustrated in the example input below:

```plumed
# compute distance:
distance: DISTANCE ATOMS=2,5
# compute total energy (potential)
energy: ENERGY
# print distance on a file
PRINT ARG=distance          STRIDE=10   FILE=COLVAR
# print both variables on another file
PRINT ARG=distance,energy   STRIDE=1000 FILE=COLVAR_ALL
```

The input above instructs plumed to print the distance between atoms 3 and 5 on a file
called COLVAR every 10 steps, and the distance and total energy on a file called COLVAR_ALL
every 1000 steps.

You can control the buffering of output using the [FLUSH](FLUSH.md) keyword. Furthermore, whether the output file is
appended or backed up depends on whetehr or not the [RESTART](RESTART.md) action is present on the file. If you add `RESTART=yes` on the
line containing the PRINT directive the file will be appended also.

Printing happens in the so-called "update" phase. This implies that printing
is affected by the presence of [UPDATE_IF](UPDATE_IF.md) actions. One can thus decide to start
and stop printing at preassigned values of time using the `UPDATE_FROM` and `UPDATE_UNTIL` keywords.
Keep into account that even on steps when the action is not updated (and thus the file is not printed)
the argument will be activated. In other words, if you use `UPDATE_FROM` to start printing at a given time,
the collective variables this PRINT statement depends on will be computed also before that time.

##Â PRINT and RESTART

If you run a calculation with the following input:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=colvar
```

and a file called colvar is already present in the directory where the calculation is running, the existing file is backed up
and renamed to `bck.0.colvar` so that new data can be output to a new file called `colvar`.  If you would like to append to the
existing file you can use the RESTART command as shown below:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=colvar RESTART=YES
```

You can achieve the same result by using the [RESTART](RESTART.md) action as shown below:

```plumed
RESTART
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=colvar
```

However, the advantage of using the RESTART keyword is that you can apped to some files and back up others as illustrated below:

```plumed
d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d1 FILE=colvar1
d2: DISTANCE ATOMS=3,4
PRINT ARG=d2 FILE=colvar2 RESTART=YES
```

If you use the input above the file `colvar1` is backed up, while new data will be appended to the file `colvar2`.  If you use the
[RESTART](RESTART.md) action instead data will be appended to both colvar files.

## Switching printing on and off

You can use the UPDATE_FROM and UPDATE_UNTIL flags to make the PRINT command only output data at certain points during the trajectory.
To see how this works consider the following example:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=colvar UPDATE_FROM=100 UPDATE_UNTIL=500 STRIDE=1
```

During the first 100 ps of the simulation with this input the distance between atoms 1 and 2 is not output to the file called colvar.
The distance is instead first output after the first 100 ps of trajectory have elapsed.  Furthermore, output of the distance stops
once the trajectory is longer than 500 ps. In other words, the distance is only output during the 400 ps time interval after the first
100 ps of the simulation.
